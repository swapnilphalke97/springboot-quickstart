# springboot-quickstart-
This Repository contains Spring-boot quick start project where we map relation between Book and there chapters. 
This is end to end application with controller, data, service layer and  RESTful api for management system. Here Spring data JPA is added and CRUD operations are
performed with JPA Repository. Postman is use to give commands like get, put, post or delete.

This code is written while I was learning spring boot quick start course on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqq-6Pq4lTTbx8p2oCgcAQGQyqN8XeA1x">JavaBrain</a> Youtube channel. So do check koushik tutorial and if have any
issue with implementation of code, you can refer this code. This code is hands on revision of spring boot quick start tutorial.

Below are screenshot of output, Note basic idea is Book having many chapters and here we are updating/post/put/deleting book/chapters. Here JPA is 
implemented but we can also manually give variable to book or chapters.
